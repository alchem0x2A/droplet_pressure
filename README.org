* A Python Module for Calculating Things about A Droplet between Parallel Plates
=droplet_pressure= is a python module for simulating droplet shape
change between parallel plates.

Basic idea behind =droplet_pressure= is the near-spherical assumption
of the droplet boundary, which inspired by [[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118401323][Berthier, J. & Brakke,
K. A. The Physics of Microdroplets]]. This module has been used to
generate the figures and animations for [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201804006][this publication]] ($LaTeX$
