* A Python Module for Simulating Droplets between Plates
=droplet_pressure= is a python module for simulating droplet shape
change between parallel plates.

** Basic Idea
Basic idea behind =droplet_pressure= is the near-spherical assumption
of the droplet boundary, which inspired by [[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118401323][Berthier, J. & Brakke,
K. A. The Physics of Microdroplets]]. This module has been used to
generate the figures and animations for [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201804006][this publication]] (LaTeX
source codes can be found [[https://github.com/lovaulonze/paper.IFET][here]]).

** Usage
*Requirements*
- =python= version 3.4+ 
- =numpy= and =scipy= (should also work for most versions, to be tested)
- =matplotlib= version 2.0.0+ (to run examples)
- =blender= version 2.70+ (to run the 3D animation)

Import the module by:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from droplet_pressure.droplet import Droplet
#+END_SRC

There are several tests to show basic functionalities, run them by:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python -m unittest tests/test_XXX.py
#+END_SRC

We also provide several examples showing the plot and animation of this module, check them by:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python -m  example.YYY
#+END_SRC

*** Special requirement for running 3D animation
We provide a blender model file =3D_animation_base.blend= for
generating the 3D animation. The script =examples/blender_gen_anim.py=
is embedded.

If you wish to generate the file from scratch, please first run the
script =blender_gen_geometry.py= to get the parameters of the droplet
per frame, and read the generated csv files using
=examples/blender_gen_anim.py=.
