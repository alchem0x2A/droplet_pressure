* A Python Module for Simulating Droplets between Plates
=droplet_pressure= is a python module for simulating droplet shape
change between parallel plates.

** Basic Idea
Basic idea behind =droplet_pressure= is the near-spherical assumption
of the droplet boundary, which inspired by [[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118401323][Berthier, J. & Brakke,
K. A. The Physics of Microdroplets]]. This module has been used to
generate the figures and animations for [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201804006][this publication]] (LaTeX
source codes can be found [[https://github.com/lovaulonze/paper.IFET][here]]).

** Usage
Import the module by:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from droplet_pressure.droplet import Droplet
#+END_SRC
